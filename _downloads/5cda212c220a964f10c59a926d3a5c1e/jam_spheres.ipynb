        "\n# Jamming of bidisperse spheres (or disks)\n\nIn this example, we'll use the bisection search algorithm to find the nearest jammed state for a set of random\nconfigurations of bidisperse spheres (or disks) in a 3D (or 2D) periodic box.\n\nThe particles use a purely repulsive harmonic interaction potential, meaning that the potential energy is zero\nwhen the particles are not in contact, and is otherwise proportional to the square of the overlap distance.\n\nThe bisection search algorithm is a simple and efficient way to find the nearest jammed state for a given configuration.\nIt works by incrementally compressing the box (equivalently growing the radii of the particles) and minimizing the total\npotential energy after each incremental compression.  If, after a compression, the potential energy is nonzero, the\nstate is said to be possibly jammed.  In this case, the system is reverted to the last unjammed state and a bisection\nsearch is performed between the jammed and unjammed states.  The algorithm will then find the largest packing fraction\nwithin the bounds which has a total potential energy near zero.  Compressing beyond this packing fraction will result\nin a drastic increase in potential energy.\n\nThe bisection search algorithm is implemented in :py:func:`~jaxdem.utils.jamming.bisection_jam`.\n"
