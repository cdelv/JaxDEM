    Abstract base class for defining inter-particle force laws and their corresponding potential energies.

    Concrete subclasses implement specific force and energy models, such as
    linear springs, Hertzian contacts, etc.

    Notes
    -----
    - The :meth:`force` and :meth:`energy` methods should correctly handle the
      case where `i` and `j` refer to the same particle (i.e., `i == j`).
      There is no guarantee that self-interaction calls will not occur.

    Example
    -------
    To define a custom force model, inherit from :class:`ForceModel` and implement
    its abstract methods:

    >>> @ForceModel.register("myCustomForce")
    >>> @jax.tree_util.register_dataclass
    >>> @dataclass(slots=True, frozen=True)
    >>> class MyCustomForce(ForceModel):
            ...
