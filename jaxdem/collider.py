class Collider(Factory["Collider"], ABC):

    The base interface for defining how contact detection and force computations are performed in a simulation.

    Concrete subclasses of `Collider` implement the specific algorithms for calculating the interactions.

    Notes
    -----
    All abstract methods in `Collider` (and their implementations in subclasses)
    must be compatible with JAX transformations (`jax.jit`, `jax.vmap`, etc.).
    They are expected to work seamlessly in both 2D and 3D simulations.

    Self-interaction (i.e., calling the force/energy computation for `i=j`) is allowed,
    and the underlying `force_model` is responsible for correctly handling or
    ignoring this case.

    Example
    -------
    To define a custom collider, inherit from `Collider`, register it and implement its abstract methods:

    >>> @Collider.register("CustomCollider")
    >>> @jax.tree_util.register_dataclass
    >>> @dataclass(slots=True)
    >>> class CustomCollider(Collider):
            ...

    Then, instantiate it:

    >>> jaxdem.Collider.create("CustomCollider", **custom_collider_kw)

    def compute_force(state: "State", system: "System") -> Tuple["State", "System"]:
        """
        Abstract method to compute the total force acting on each particle in the simulation.

        Implementations should calculate inter-particle forces based on the current
        `state` and `system` configuration, then update the `accel` attribute of the
        `state` object with the resulting total acceleration for each particle.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : State
            The current state of the simulation.
        system : System
            The configuration of the simulation.

        Returns
        -------
        Tuple[State, System]
            A tuple containing the updated `State` object (with computed accelerations)
            and the `System` object.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            This is an abstract method and must be implemented by subclasses.

        Example
        -------
        This method is typically called internally by the `System`'s step function:

        Implementations should calculate the sum of all potential energies
        present in the system based on the current `state` and `system` configuration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : State
            The current state of the simulation.

    Implementation that computes forces and potential energies using a naive :math:`O(N^2)` all-pairs interaction loop.

    Notes
    -----
    Due to its :math:`O(N^2)` complexity, `NaiveSimulator` is suitable for simulations
    with a relatively small number of particles. For larger systems, a more
    efficient spatial partitioning collider should be used. However, thhis collider should be the fastest
    option for small systems (:math:`<10^3` spheres)
