Interface for defining data writers.

This module provides a high-level VTKWriter and CheckpointWriter frontend, a VTKBaseWriter
plugin interface, and concrete writers (e.g., VTKSpheresWriter, VTKDomainWriter)
for exporting JAX-based simulation snapshots to VTK files.

    Abstract base class for writers that output simulation data.

    Concrete subclasses implement the `write` method to specify how a given
    snapshot (:class:`jaxdem.State`, :class:`jaxdem.System` pair) is converted into a
    specific file format.

    Example
    -------
    To define a custom VTK writer, inherit from `VTKBaseWriter` and implement its abstract methods:

    >>> @VTKBaseWriter.register("my_custom_vtk_writer")
    >>> @dataclass(slots=True, flozen=True)
    >>> class MyCustomVTKWriter(VTKBaseWriter):
            ...

    ):
        """
        Write information from a simulation snapshot to a VTK PolyData file.

        This abstract method is the core interface for all concrete VTK writers.
        Implementations should assume that all jax arrays are converted to numpy arrays
        before write is called.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : State
            The simulation :class:`jaxdem.State` snapshot to be written.
        system : System
            The simulation :class:`jaxdem.System` configuration.
        filename : Path
            Target path where the VTK file should be saved. The caller
            guarantees that it exists.
        binary : bool
            If `True`, the VTK file is written in binary mode; if `False`,
            it is written in ASCII (human-readable) mode.
