    A :class:`VTKBaseWriter` that writes particle centers as VTK points and

    For each particle, its position is written as a point. Relevant per-particle
    fields (e.g., ``vel``, ``rad``, ``mass``) are exported as arrays.
    Positions and 2-component vectors are padded to 3D as required by VTK.
