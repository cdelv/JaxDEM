Interface for defining data writers.

This module provides a high-level VTKWriter frontend, a VTKBaseWriter
plugin interface, and concrete writers (e.g., SpheresWriter, DomainWriter)
for exporting JAX-based simulation snapshots to VTK files. It also contains
utilities for safe directory cleanup and an (experimental) checkpointing
wrapper.

    Attributes
    ----------
    directory : Path
        Base directory where checkpoints are stored. Defaults to "./checkpoints".
    clean : bool
        If True, the directory is cleared on initialization (when safe to do so).
    max_to_keep : int | None
        Maximum number of checkpoints to keep. If None, keep all.
    save_interval_steps : int
        Intended interval (in steps) between successive auto-saves.
    checkpointer : ocp.CheckpointManager
        Underlying Orbax checkpoint manager (currently None).
