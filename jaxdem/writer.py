@dataclass(slots=True)
class VTKWriter:
    """
    High-level front-end for writing simulation data to VTK files.

    This class orchestrates the process of converting JAX-based `State` and
    `System` PyTrees into VTK files, handling batching, trajectories, and
    dispatching to concrete :class:`VTKBaseWriter` subclasses.

    How leading axes are interpreted
    --------------------------------
    Given `state.pos.shape == (..., N, dim)` where `N` is the particle index
    and `dim` is the spatial dimension (2 or 3). Let `L` be the number of
    remaining *leading* axes (i.e., `L = state.pos.ndim - 2`).

    1.  If `L == 0`:
        The input represents a **single snapshot**. All writers directly process it.

    2.  If `L >= 1` and `trajectory` is :obj:`False` (default behavior of :meth:`save`):
        -   Axis 0 is treated as a **batch** dimension.
        -   Axes 1 through `L-1` are treated as **trajectory** dimensions within each batch.
        This means each slice along axis 0 (`state.pos[b, ...]`) is considered a separate
        batch. Each batch is then processed recursively, with its remaining leading axes
        treated as a trajectory. Separate subdirectories (e.g., `batch_00000000/`) are
        created for each batch.

    3.  If `L >= 1` and `trajectory` is :obj:`True`:
        -   **All** leading axes (from axis 0 up to `L-1`) are treated as **trajectory** dimensions.
        This is suitable for cases like "trajectory of trajectories" (e.g., from Monte Carlo runs)
        or when the primary leading dimension is explicitly time.

    Inside each batch directory (or the main `directory` for non-batched trajectories),
    every trajectory step becomes one or more VTK files per concrete writer
    (e.g., `spheres_00000042.vtp`, `domain_00000042.vtp`).

    Requirements on `system`
    ------------------------
    The `System` object may share leading axes with `state` or be broadcastable
    (e.g., a scalar `dt` for all particles/batches/frames). During the recursive
    processing, every array leaf of `system` that has a length matching the
    current leading axis (`lead`) is sliced together with the corresponding `state` slice.
    This ensures that each individual writer receives matching per-snapshot
    `State` and `System` objects.

    Notes
    -----
    - All I/O operations (file writing) are executed in a single `ThreadPoolExecutor`
      managed by the `VTKWriter` instance, allowing for concurrent file writes.
    - A global counter (`_counter`) is incremented *before* a snapshot is submitted
      to the thread pool. This guarantees unique file names for all output files,
      even when threads finish out of order due to background execution.
    - `VTKWriter` itself is **not** a JAX PyTree (it's a standard Python dataclass)
      and therefore never appears inside `jax.jit` or `jax.vmap` transforms;
      it operates purely on the Python side.

class DomainWriter(VTKBaseWriter):
    """
    A `VTKBaseWriter` implementation that writes the simulation domain as a VTK geometric primitive.

    The domain is represented as an axis-aligned cuboid (for 3D simulations) or
    a rectangle (for 2D simulations). Its position is determined by `system.domain.anchor`
    and `system.domain.box_size`.

    Notes
    -----
    - The domain's dimensions from :attr:`system.domain.box_size` are automatically padded
      to 3D if the simulation is 2D, as required by VTK's `vtkCubeSource`.
    - The center of the VTK cube/rectangle is set to `anchor + 0.5 * box_size`.

        Writes the simulation domain geometry to a VTK PolyData (.vtp) file.

        The domain is represented as a `vtkCubeSource`, automatically adjusting
        for 2D or 3D simulation dimensions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : State
            The simulation state snapshot (NumPy-converted).
            (Note: Not directly used by `DomainWriter`, but required by base signature.)
        system : System
            The simulation system configuration (NumPy-converted), providing
            `domain.anchor` and `domain.box_size`.
        counter : int
            The unique integer identifier for this snapshot.
        directory : pathlib.Path or str
            The target directory for the output file.
        binary : bool
            If `True`, writes in binary mode; `False` for ASCII.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            The incremented counter (`counter + 1`).
