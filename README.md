JaxDEM is a lightweight, fully [https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/](JAX)-compatible Python library that empowers researchers and engineers to easily perform high-performance Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations in 2D and 3D. Every simulation component is written with pure JAX arrays so that you can:

*   JIT-compile the entire solver.
*   Run thousands of simulations in parallel with `vmap`.
*   Collect trajectories with `jax.lax.scan` to avoid interrupting the simulation for I/O operations.
*   The provided VTK writer understands when you pass it a batched simulation state or a trajectory, and saves every VTK file concurrently.
*   Ship the computation seamlessly to CPU/GPU/TPU.
*   Interface easily with ML workloads.
*   Keep the codebase short, hackable, and fun.

Whether exploring granular materials, designing new manufacturing processes, working on molecular dynamics, or robotics, JaxDEM provides a robust and easily extendable framework to bring your simulations to life.

## Example

A minimal simulation with I/O output in JAX might look like this:

```python
import jaxdem as jdem
from jaxdem.utils import grid_state
import jax.numpy as jnp

state = grid_state(n_per_axis=(10, 10, 10), spacing=0.5, radius=0.1) # Initialize particles aranged in a grid
system = jdem.System.create(state.dim, domain_type="reflect", domain_kw={"box_size": 20.0 * jnp.ones(state.dim)})
writer = jdem.VTKWriter()
steps = 1000
n_every = 10

for step in range(steps):
    if step % n_every == 0:
        writer.save(state, system)      # blocks until files are on disk

    state, system = jdem.System.step(state, system)
```

However, there is an even simpler and more performant way! You can accumulate the trajectory with `jax.lax.scan`. As `VTKWriter` understands batch and trajectory axes, you do not have to interleave I/O with computation in a Python loop.

No need to complicate yourself with `scan`; we already did it for you:

```python
state, system, (traj_state, traj_sys) = jdem.system.trajectory_rollout(state, system,
        n      = steps // n_every,   # number of frames
        stride = n_every             # steps between frames
)

writer.save(traj_state, traj_sys, trajectory=True)
```

### Advantages of the second pattern

| Feature              | Inside-loop I/O            | Rollout + One Save       |
| :------------------  | :------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| I/O Barrier          | Every call to `save`       | **None**                 |
| Python â†” Device Sync | Every call to `save`       | Only once                |
| Memory Footprint     | Single snapshot            | `n` snapshots in RAM     |

### Why is it fast?

1.  `trajectory_rollout` is implemented with `jax.lax.scan`, the most efficient way to accumulate data inside a JIT-compiled section; no Python overhead is incurred per step.

2.  The generated trajectory is still a pure PyTree of arrays, so
    `writer.save` can simultaneously dispatch all frames to the thread-pool.

3.  The only extra cost is RAM. For large scenes, you can trade memory for speed by increasing `n_every`
    (fewer frames kept in memory) or by writing batches of, say, 100
    frames at a time.
